## 📌 Project Overview

This project answers key business questions for an online retail company:

* Who are the most valuable customers?
* Which customer segments are at risk of churning?
* How well does the company retain customers over time?
* What are the revenue and order trends by month, country, and product?

The pipeline goes from **raw Excel data → cleaned CSV → PostgreSQL views → Power BI visuals**.

## 🔍 Key Analyses

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

**Notebook:** `01_data_cleaning_with_Python/retail_data_cleaning_and_preparation.ipynb`

* Combined two Excel sheets (2009–2010 and 2010–2011) into a single DataFrame of **1,067,371 rows**
* Flagged cancellation invoices (prefix `C`) with an `is_cancelled` column
* Dropped rows with missing `Description` (**4,382 rows removed**)
* Standardized column names to lowercase snake_case
* Added `total_price` column (`quantity × unit_price`)
* Final clean dataset: **1,062,989 rows** exported to `online_retail_cleaned.csv`

**Notebook:** `01_data_cleaning_with_Python/Queries.ipynb`

* Imported cleaned CSV into PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy
* Created the `retail_data` table and ran validation queries

---

### 2. KPI Queries

**Script:** `02_sql_scripts_in_PostgreSQL/kpi_test_queries.sql`

Eight SQL views covering the core business KPIs:

| View                           | Description                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `total_orders_revenue`         | Overall revenue, order count, and customer count  |
| `yearly_revenue_order_summary` | Revenue and orders broken down by year            |
| `monthly_revenue`              | Monthly revenue trend with active customer counts |
| `top_customers`                | Customers ranked by total spend                   |
| `country_summary`              | Revenue and orders by country                     |
| `product_sales_summary`        | Top-selling products by quantity and revenue      |
| `segment_revenue_summary`      | Revenue breakdown by RFM customer segment         |
| `new_vs_returning_customers`   | Monthly split of new vs. returning customers      |
| `cancel_rate_summary`          | Cancellation rate trend over time                 |

---

### 3. Cohort Analysis

**Folder:** `03_cohort_analysis/`

Customers are grouped by their **first purchase month (cohort)**. The analysis then tracks how many of those customers, and how much revenue, return in each subsequent month from **Month 0 through Month 12**.

Two output views:

* **Customer-level cohort** — how many customers from each cohort return month over month
* **Revenue-level cohort** — how much revenue each cohort generates in subsequent months

This reveals retention drop-off rates and identifies which acquisition periods produced the most loyal customers.

For a full methodology walkthrough, see:

`03_cohort_analysis/README.md`

### 4. RFM Segmentation

**Folder:** `04_RFM_segmentation/`

RFM (**Recency, Frequency, Monetary**) scoring assigns each customer a value on three dimensions:

| Dimension     | Definition                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Recency**   | Days since last purchase (lower = better) |
| **Frequency** | Number of distinct invoices               |
| **Monetary**  | Total spend (GBP)                         |

Each metric is scored **1–4** using `NTILE(4)`, producing a 3-digit RFM code (for example, `444`). Customers are then mapped to six business segments:

| Segment                        | Description                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Loyal**                      | High scores across all three metrics    |
| **Active**                     | Regularly purchasing, engaged customers |
| **New Customers**              | Recent first-time buyers                |
| **Potential Churners**         | Moderate risk — declining engagement    |
| **Slipping Away, Cannot Lose** | Were high-value, now going quiet        |
| **Churned Customer**           | Low recency, frequency, and spend       |

**Output:** `04_RFM_segmentation/rfm_final_score.csv`

For full segment definitions and scoring logic, see:

`04_RFM_segmentation/README.md`

### 5. 📊 Power BI Dashboard

**File:** `05_power_bi_dashboard/Retail_analysis.pbix`

An interactive Power BI report built on top of the PostgreSQL views and CSV outputs. It brings together all analyses into a single dashboard for business stakeholder reporting.

To open the dashboard, download the `.pbix` file and open it in **Power BI Desktop**.
